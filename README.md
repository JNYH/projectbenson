# Project-Benson

This is the first project in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, done by my team of 3 members 
(we are randomly grouped into groups of 4, but this team happens to be the remainding 3)
Project goal is to solve a problem for an imaginary New York organization, WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY).

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we a are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.
To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.
Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.
The ball is in your court now — do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.

Best,
Karrine and Dahlia
WTWY International
